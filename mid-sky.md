The **Peaky Blinders** were an urban street gang based in Birmingham, *England*, that operated from the end of the 19th century, and after First World War. The group, which grew out of the harsh economic deprivations of working class Britain, was composed largely of young unemployed men.

The Blindersâ€™ dominance came about from beating rivals such as the "Sloggers" whom they fought for territory in Birmingham and its surrounding districts
